# 🌙 Insomnia Protocol  

> **Deposit once, farm everywhere — maximize your Somnia rewards with Insomnia.**  

---

## 📝 What is Insomnia?  
**Insomnia Protocol** is a DeFi vault system built on the **Somnia Network**.  
It allows users to deposit their native token **SOM** once and automatically:  
- Earn yield through actively managed strategies  
- Accumulate airdrop points across multiple protocols in the Somnia ecosystem  
- Simplify DeFi participation with a **one-click solution**  

---

## ❓ Problem Insomnia Solves  
The Somnia ecosystem offers many opportunities to earn airdrop points and yields, but users face challenges:  

- **Fragmented Point Systems** – Each protocol has its own point program  
- **Complex Management** – Manually tracking deposits, withdrawals, and points is time-consuming  
- **Gas Inefficiency** – Multiple transactions across protocols waste gas  
- **Missed Opportunities** – Users often fail to optimize allocations due to lack of tools or time  

👉 **Insomnia** solves this by unifying the process into a single vault system that manages everything automatically.
